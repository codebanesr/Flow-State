### Key Components

1. **Container Orchestration**
   - Uses Docker SDK to create containers with Traefik labels
   - Generates unique paths using container IDs
   - Manages port mapping through Traefik service labels

2. **Security**
   - Basic authentication for all endpoints
   - Automatic HTTPS via Let's Encrypt
   - Isolation through containerization

3. **Routing**
   - Traefik handles path-based routing
   - Automatic service discovery via Docker provider
   - Path prefix stripping middleware

### Workflow

1. User sends POST request to `/containers`
2. Go service:
   - Generates unique container ID
   - Creates Docker container with Traefik labels
   - Attaches container to Traefik network
3. Traefik:
   - Detects new container via Docker provider
   - Creates routes with HTTPS and basic auth
   - Obtains Let's Encrypt certificate
4. User accesses:
   - `https://yourdomain.com/<container-id>` - Browser control
   - `https://yourdomain.com/<container-id>/debug` - Playwright endpoint

### Next Steps

1. Create the base Traefik setup
2. Implement the Docker client initialization
3. Add error handling and container cleanup
4. Implement proper authentication mechanisms
5. Add health checks and monitoring

### Plan
So the plan is:

1. The Go service exposes an API endpoint (e.g., POST /containers) to create a new container.

2. When creating the container, the Go service uses the Docker SDK to start the container with the appropriate labels for Traefik routing and auth.

3. Traefik is configured to use Let's Encrypt for SSL, with basic auth middleware.

4. Traefik routes requests to /container_id and /container_id/debug to the respective ports on the container.

Now, the structure of the Go project. Let's outline the files and functions.


https://yourdomain.com/api/containers → Management API
https://yourdomain.com/{id}/ui → Browser UI
https://yourdomain.com/{id}/debug → Debug endpoint
